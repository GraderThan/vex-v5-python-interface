# VexV5 Python Interface for IDEs

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, Python enthusiasts and Vex Robotics lovers! Welcome to the GitHub
repository for our Python interface tailored specifically for Vex V5. This
interface isn't your typical fully-functional library. Instead, it is designed
to enrich your programming experience so that smart type-hints and auto-complete
features work within your IDE. 

## Why This Repository?
You're probably wondering, "Why do I need this?" Well, here's the deal:

1. **Type-Hinting & Auto-Completion**: Whether you're using the Greater Than IDE, Visual
   Studio Code, or PyCharm, this interface will help your IDE provide helpful hints and
   suggestions as you type, reducing errors and speeding up your coding process.

2. **Temporary Solution**: Consider this a placeholder, a stepping stone if you
   will. Vex hasn't released their official Python package yet. So, until they
   do, we've got you covered! 


## Getting Started With Grader Than:

After completing these steps your students in your course will have the Official Vex
IDE extension and full IDE support for vex. 

**Prerequisites:** It is assumed you already have a [Grader Than Workspace
setup](https://docs.graderthan.com/workspace/create/). 

1. Create a dependency, named `vex`. See these
   [docs](https://docs.graderthan.com/workspace/config/#create-a-dependency) for
   more details on how to create a dependency. 
2. Use the code below as your install script for the `vex` dependency you
   created in step 1.
   
   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   rootdir=/tmp/vex

   # Setup files
   mkdir -p $rootdir
   cd $rootdir
   git clone https://github.com/graderthan/vex-v5-python-interface.git
   cd ./vex-v5-python-interface

   # Install the official vex extension in the background
   chmod +x ./ext/install.sh
   ./ext/install.sh &

   # Install the type-hinting and autocomplete tools

   user_pip_path="/home/developer/Documents/code/.venv/bin/pip"
   if [ -f "$user_pip_path" ]; then
      source "/home/developer/Documents/code/.venv/bin/activate"
      "$user_pip_path" install ./
      deactivate
   else
      pip install ./
   fi

   # Wait for everything to complete and cleanup
   wait
   rm -rf $rootdir
   ```

3. **ðŸ¥³ Done!** Now all your students and your course will have the Official Vex
   IDE extension and with full IDE support.
